# Codecademy Capstones 
Adding my capstone projects from Codecademy here.

The machine learning capstone analyzes data from OK-Cupid with various ML algorithms to try to generate some information based on age, income, diet, drink and smoking habits.

The capstone uses common classification and regression models, such as Support Vector Machines, K nearest neighbors, etc.
